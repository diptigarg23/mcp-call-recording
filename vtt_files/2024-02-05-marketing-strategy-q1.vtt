00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Emma Williams (CMO): Good afternoon team. Let's review our Q1 marketing performance and plan for Q2.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Carlos Mendez (Demand Gen): Our paid search campaigns are performing well. We're seeing a 15% increase in qualified leads compared to Q4.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Emma Williams (CMO): That's excellent. What's driving that improvement?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Carlos Mendez (Demand Gen): We refined our keyword strategy and started targeting more bottom-of-funnel terms. Cost per lead is down 20% as well.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Olivia Chen (Content Marketing): On the content side, our buyer persona guides are getting great engagement. The CTO persona guide alone generated 200 downloads last month.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Emma Williams (CMO): Impressive. Are those converting to opportunities?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Olivia Chen (Content Marketing): Sales is reporting that about 30% of those downloads are engaging with our sales team. Much higher than our typical content.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Marcus Taylor (Product Marketing): We should create more persona-specific content. I'm hearing from sales that CFOs want ROI calculators.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Emma Williams (CMO): Good insight. Olivia, can you work with Marcus on an interactive ROI tool for Q2?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Olivia Chen (Content Marketing): Absolutely. I'll need design and dev resources for the interactive component.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Emma Williams (CMO): I'll arrange that. Carlos, what about our event strategy?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Carlos Mendez (Demand Gen): We're confirmed for three major conferences in Q2. I'm also exploring smaller regional events that might have better ROI.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Marcus Taylor (Product Marketing): The healthcare conference in April would be perfect for launching our HIPAA compliance messaging.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Emma Williams (CMO): Great idea. Let's make that a focus. I want strong booth presence and at least two speaking slots.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Carlos Mendez (Demand Gen): I'll reach out to the organizers this week about speaking opportunities.
