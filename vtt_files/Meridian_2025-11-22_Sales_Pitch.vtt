WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Jennifer Martinez: Good afternoon everyone! Thanks so much for taking the time today.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Jennifer Martinez: I'm Jennifer Martinez, Enterprise Account Executive at Forrester.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Michael Stevens: Hi Jennifer, I'm Michael Stevens, CIO at Meridian Financial.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.800
Michael Stevens: Thanks for reaching out. I have my team here as well.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.000
Rachel Kim: Rachel Kim, VP of Technology Strategy.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.200
David Porter: And I'm David Porter, Head of Enterprise Architecture.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.500
Jennifer Martinez: Wonderful to meet you all. I also have Tom Chen with me today.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.800
Tom Chen: Hi everyone, Tom Chen, Principal Analyst covering financial services.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.000
Tom Chen: I focus specifically on digital transformation in banking.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.500
Jennifer Martinez: Perfect. So Michael, I really appreciate you taking this meeting.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Jennifer Martinez: I know you reached out after seeing our recent report on AI modernization.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.200
Jennifer Martinez: Before I dive in, can you share what prompted your interest?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.500
Michael Stevens: Sure. We're in the middle of a major technology transformation.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.800
Michael Stevens: We've got competing priorities around cloud migration, AI implementation.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.200
Michael Stevens: Cybersecurity upgrades, legacy system modernization.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.500
Michael Stevens: Frankly, we're struggling to prioritize and sequence these initiatives.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.800
Michael Stevens: And the board is asking tough questions about ROI and timeline.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.200
Rachel Kim: We're also concerned about being left behind by more agile competitors.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.500
Rachel Kim: We see fintechs and neobanks moving fast on digital experiences.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.800
Rachel Kim: Our customers are expecting that same level of innovation from us.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.200
Jennifer Martinez: That's exactly the challenge we help financial services firms navigate.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.500
Jennifer Martinez: You're definitely not alone - this is the number one pain point we hear.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.800
Tom Chen: Michael, if I can jump in - I've worked with over 50 financial institutions.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.200
Tom Chen: And what you're describing is a pattern we see constantly.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.500
Tom Chen: The challenge isn't lack of technology options, it's strategic clarity.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.800
Tom Chen: Most organizations are trying to do too much without a clear framework.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.200
Michael Stevens: That resonates. We have about 30 initiatives in flight right now.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.500
Michael Stevens: And honestly, I couldn't tell you which ones truly matter most.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.800
Jennifer Martinez: So let me walk you through how Forrester could support you.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.200
Jennifer Martinez: We offer three core value propositions for organizations like yours.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.500
Jennifer Martinez: First, strategic guidance from analysts like Tom who know your industry.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.800
Jennifer Martinez: Second, proprietary research and data to benchmark your performance.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.200
Jennifer Martinez: And third, practical frameworks and tools to execute transformation.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.500
Jennifer Martinez: Tom, maybe you could talk about how this would work specifically for Meridian?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.800
Tom Chen: Absolutely. Based on what you've shared, I'd recommend starting with an inquiry.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.200
Tom Chen: This is where we'd spend time understanding your current state and goals.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.500
Tom Chen: Then we'd help you build a prioritized technology roadmap.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.800
Tom Chen: We use our Tech Tide framework to assess which technologies are mature enough.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.200
Tom Chen: And which require more time before enterprise adoption.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.500
David Porter: How does that differ from what the big consulting firms offer?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.800
David Porter: We've had McKinsey and Deloitte pitch us similar roadmap services.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.200
Tom Chen: Great question. The key difference is we're not selling implementation services.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.500
Tom Chen: We're truly independent - we don't have a vested interest in which vendors you choose.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.800
Tom Chen: Our research is based on surveying thousands of enterprises and technology buyers.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.200
Tom Chen: So you're getting data-driven insights, not just one consultant's opinion.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.500
Tom Chen: And our analyst community means you get expertise across multiple domains.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.800
Tom Chen: If you need cloud guidance, I can bring in our cloud analysts.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.200
Tom Chen: If you need security expertise, we have analysts who focus solely on that.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.500
Rachel Kim: That's interesting. How many analyst inquiries would we get?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.800
Jennifer Martinez: With the contract tier I'm recommending for you, it's unlimited inquiries.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
Jennifer Martinez: You could speak with our analysts as often as you need throughout the year.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.500
Jennifer Martinez: Most clients at your size typically do 20 to 40 inquiries annually.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.800
Jennifer Martinez: Some tactical, 30-minute calls, others deep-dive strategy sessions.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.200
Michael Stevens: What does a typical inquiry look like? Can you give me an example?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.500
Tom Chen: Sure. Let me give you a recent example from another regional bank.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.800
Tom Chen: They were evaluating generative AI platforms for customer service.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.200
Tom Chen: They had vendors pitching them - IBM, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.500
Tom Chen: They came to me with their requirements and the vendor proposals.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.800
Tom Chen: We spent an hour walking through the pros and cons of each option.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.200
Tom Chen: I shared our vendor assessments, which include customer reference data.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.500
Tom Chen: I also flagged regulatory considerations specific to financial services.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.800
Tom Chen: They left with a clear recommendation and felt confident in their decision.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.200
Tom Chen: That kind of inquiry saves them months of evaluation time and reduces risk.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.500
David Porter: Do you have assessments of all major technology vendors?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.800
Jennifer Martinez: We evaluate over 4,000 vendors across different categories.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.200
Jennifer Martinez: We publish Forrester Wave reports which are our in-depth competitive evaluations.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.500
Jennifer Martinez: We look at 25 to 30 criteria for each vendor in a category.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.800
Jennifer Martinez: We also do continuous vendor landscape tracking between Waves.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.200
Tom Chen: And importantly, vendors don't pay to be included in our research.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.500
Tom Chen: Our revenue comes from you, the buyer, not from vendors.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.800
Tom Chen: That's what enables us to give unbiased recommendations.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.200
Rachel Kim: What about research? You mentioned proprietary research earlier.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.500
Jennifer Martinez: Yes, this is a huge part of the value. Let me pull up our research portal.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.800
Jennifer Martinez: We publish over 2,000 research documents per year.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.200
Jennifer Martinez: Everything from tactical how-to guides to strategic market forecasts.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.500
Jennifer Martinez: For financial services specifically, Tom's team publishes weekly.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.800
Tom Chen: We cover topics like digital banking transformation, AI implementation.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.200
Tom Chen: Core banking modernization, customer experience optimization.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.500
Tom Chen: Regulatory technology, embedded finance, open banking strategies.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.800
Michael Stevens: How quickly do you respond to emerging trends?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.200
Michael Stevens: Like when ChatGPT launched, how fast did you have guidance on that?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.500
Tom Chen: We actually published our first generative AI guidance within two weeks of launch.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.800
Tom Chen: We have a rapid response research process for game-changing developments.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.200
Tom Chen: And we were already tracking large language models before ChatGPT went viral.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.500
Tom Chen: So our clients weren't caught flat-footed when their boards started asking questions.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.800
Jennifer Martinez: That's actually a good segue to talk about executive programs.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.200
Jennifer Martinez: We have resources specifically designed for communicating with your board.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.500
Jennifer Martinez: Executive briefings, board-ready presentations, business case templates.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.800
Rachel Kim: That would be incredibly helpful. We're constantly preparing board materials.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.200
Rachel Kim: It would save us significant time to have frameworks we could customize.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.500
Jennifer Martinez: Exactly. And we can also do custom executive briefings.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.800
Jennifer Martinez: Tom or another analyst could present directly to your board if helpful.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.200
Jennifer Martinez: We've done this for many clients - gives an outside expert perspective.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.500
Michael Stevens: Interesting. What would something like that cost?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.800
Jennifer Martinez: Custom briefings are included in the enterprise tier membership.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.200
Jennifer Martinez: Let me walk you through the membership structure and pricing.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.500
Jennifer Martinez: We have three tiers - Foundation, Leadership, and Enterprise.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.800
Jennifer Martinez: Based on your organization's size and needs, I'd recommend Enterprise.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.200
Jennifer Martinez: That gives you unlimited analyst inquiries, full research access.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.500
Jennifer Martinez: Priority scheduling, custom briefings, and access to our tools and templates.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.800
Jennifer Martinez: For Meridian, the annual investment would be $425,000.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.200
Jennifer Martinez: That covers up to 25 named users across your technology organization.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.500
Michael Stevens: That's... not an insignificant investment. Help me understand the ROI.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.800
Jennifer Martinez: Absolutely fair question. Let me break down how clients typically see value.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.200
Jennifer Martinez: First, vendor selection optimization. One bad vendor decision can cost millions.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.500
Jennifer Martinez: Our research helps you avoid costly mistakes and negotiate better.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.800
Jennifer Martinez: Second, faster decision-making. Time is money in technology.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.200
Jennifer Martinez: If we help you make decisions 30% faster, that's significant competitive value.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.500
Jennifer Martinez: Third, risk reduction. Failed technology projects are incredibly expensive.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.800
Tom Chen: Let me add some context from similar financial institutions.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.200
Tom Chen: We worked with a bank similar to your size last year.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.500
Tom Chen: They were about to invest $8 million in a core banking platform.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.800
Tom Chen: Through our inquiry process, we identified critical gaps in the vendor's offering.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.200
Tom Chen: They ended up choosing a different vendor that was better suited to their needs.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.500
Tom Chen: They estimate we saved them from a failed implementation that would have cost.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.800
Tom Chen: Tens of millions in switching costs and lost opportunity.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.200
David Porter: Do you provide implementation guidance or just strategic advice?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.500
Tom Chen: We focus on the strategic and planning phases primarily.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.800
Tom Chen: We help you make the right decisions about what to do and how to approach it.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.200
Tom Chen: We provide implementation frameworks and best practices.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.500
Tom Chen: But we don't do the hands-on implementation work that consultancies do.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.800
Tom Chen: Many clients use us to plan, then hire implementers to execute.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.200
Tom Chen: And we can help you evaluate and select those implementation partners too.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.500
Rachel Kim: What about peer networking? Do you facilitate connections with other banks?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.800
Jennifer Martinez: Yes! This is actually one of our most valued benefits.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.200
Jennifer Martinez: We host executive forums and peer roundtables throughout the year.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.500
Jennifer Martinez: These bring together technology leaders from financial services firms.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.800
Jennifer Martinez: You'd be connecting with CIOs from banks of similar size and complexity.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.200
Jennifer Martinez: Many clients tell us the peer connections alone are worth the membership.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.500
Tom Chen: We also facilitate customer reference conversations.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.800
Tom Chen: If you're evaluating a technology, I can connect you with other banks using it.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.200
Tom Chen: We have relationships with thousands of technology leaders.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.500
Michael Stevens: That's actually really valuable. We struggle to get honest vendor feedback.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.800
Michael Stevens: Vendors only give us references who will say positive things.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.200
Tom Chen: Exactly. We can connect you with both successful and challenged implementations.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.500
Tom Chen: So you get the full picture, not just the curated success stories.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.800
Jennifer Martinez: Let me also mention our data and benchmarking capabilities.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.200
Jennifer Martinez: We survey thousands of technology decision-makers quarterly.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.500
Jennifer Martinez: You can benchmark your technology spending, staffing, and priorities.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.800
Jennifer Martinez: Against peers in your industry and size category.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.200
Rachel Kim: That would help us tremendously with budget justification.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.500
Rachel Kim: Our CFO always wants to know how we compare to industry norms.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.800
Jennifer Martinez: We have clients who use our data in every board presentation.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.200
Jennifer Martinez: It adds credibility and context to your recommendations.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.500
David Porter: What about technical architecture guidance?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.800
David Porter: We're trying to move to microservices and cloud-native architectures.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.200
Tom Chen: We have architects who specialize in enterprise architecture patterns.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.500
Tom Chen: They can review your architecture plans and provide feedback.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.800
Tom Chen: We also have reference architectures and blueprints you can customize.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.200
Tom Chen: For financial services, we have specific guidance on regulatory compliance.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.500
Tom Chen: Data residency, security controls, audit requirements.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.800
Michael Stevens: How do you stay current? Technology changes so fast.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.200
Tom Chen: We have a continuous research model. I personally speak with.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.500
Tom Chen: Dozens of financial institutions every month gathering intelligence.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.800
Tom Chen: We also maintain relationships with all major technology vendors.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.200
Tom Chen: We get early briefings on product roadmaps and strategy changes.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.500
Tom Chen: And we're constantly analyzing market trends and disruptions.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.800
Jennifer Martinez: Tom attends dozens of industry conferences each year too.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.200
Jennifer Martinez: He's often a keynote speaker sharing Forrester's research.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.500
Rachel Kim: Do you cover emerging technologies like quantum computing?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.800
Tom Chen: We do, though I'd characterize quantum as very early stage still.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.200
Tom Chen: We have analysts tracking quantum and can provide reality checks.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.500
Tom Chen: On when it becomes relevant for financial services use cases.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.800
Tom Chen: Right now, honestly, most firms should be watching but not investing heavily.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.200
Tom Chen: We're probably 5 to 10 years from practical enterprise applications.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.500
Michael Stevens: That's helpful context. What about AI governance?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.800
Michael Stevens: We're getting pressure to deploy AI but also to govern it responsibly.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.200
Tom Chen: This is one of our hottest topics right now. We have an entire practice.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.500
Tom Chen: Focused on AI ethics, governance, and risk management.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.800
Tom Chen: We've developed frameworks for responsible AI implementation.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.200
Tom Chen: Including model validation, bias detection, explainability requirements.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.500
Tom Chen: For banks, this is critical given regulatory scrutiny.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.800
Jennifer Martinez: We actually just published a major report on AI governance last month.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.200
Jennifer Martinez: If you become a member, that would be immediately available to you.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.500
Michael Stevens: How does onboarding work if we decide to move forward?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.800
Jennifer Martinez: Great question. We have a structured onboarding process.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.200
Jennifer Martinez: First, we'd have a kickoff call to understand your priority initiatives.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.500
Jennifer Martinez: Then we assign you to relevant analysts based on your focus areas.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.800
Jennifer Martinez: We'd set up your team on our research portal and tools.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.200
Jennifer Martinez: And schedule your first inquiry sessions within the first two weeks.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.500
Jennifer Martinez: We also provide training on how to get maximum value from the membership.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.800
Rachel Kim: How many inquiries do you think we'd need in the first quarter?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.200
Tom Chen: Based on what you've shared, I'd suggest planning for 8 to 10.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.500
Tom Chen: You could do a deep dive on your technology roadmap prioritization.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.800
Tom Chen: A session on AI implementation strategy.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.200
Tom Chen: Cloud migration planning, vendor evaluations for specific initiatives.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.500
Tom Chen: And probably some tactical inquiries as needs arise.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.800
David Porter: Can we involve our broader team or just senior leadership?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.200
Jennifer Martinez: With 25 seats, you can include directors and senior managers too.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.500
Jennifer Martinez: Many clients give access to their architecture team, security team.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.800
Jennifer Martinez: Innovation team, and project managers leading major initiatives.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.200
Jennifer Martinez: This ensures everyone is working from the same strategic insights.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.500
Michael Stevens: What's the contract term? Is this an annual commitment?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.800
Jennifer Martinez: Yes, it's an annual membership that renews automatically.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.200
Jennifer Martinez: We find it takes a full year to realize the value of the relationship.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.500
Jennifer Martinez: But we can discuss payment terms - monthly, quarterly, or annual.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.800
Michael Stevens: And if we're not satisfied, is there an exit option?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.200
Jennifer Martinez: We have a 90-day satisfaction guarantee.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.500
Jennifer Martinez: If you're not seeing value, we can work together to adjust the engagement.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.800
Jennifer Martinez: Or in rare cases, we'd process a prorated refund.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.200
Jennifer Martinez: But honestly, our renewal rate is over 90 percent.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.500
Jennifer Martinez: Once clients start using the service, they find it indispensable.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.800
Rachel Kim: Can you share some client success stories from financial services?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.200
Tom Chen: Sure, though I'll keep names confidential. We worked with a regional bank.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.500
Tom Chen: Similar size to Meridian, who was struggling with digital banking transformation.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.800
Tom Chen: They had tried to build their own digital platform and it stalled.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.200
Tom Chen: We helped them understand why their approach wasn't working.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.500
Tom Chen: Recommended a build-versus-buy assessment framework.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.800
Tom Chen: They ended up partnering with a digital banking platform provider.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.200
Tom Chen: Launched their new digital experience in 18 months versus the original 3-year timeline.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.500
Tom Chen: And came in 40 percent under their original budget.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.800
Tom Chen: They credit Forrester with helping them avoid a costly mistake.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.200
Michael Stevens: That's a compelling example. What about specific vendor recommendations?

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.500
Michael Stevens: Can you tell us who we should work with for specific technology needs?

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.800
Tom Chen: Yes, but with appropriate context. We don't have a standard answer.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.200
Tom Chen: For every organization because your requirements are unique.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.500
Tom Chen: What works for one bank might not work for Meridian.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.800
Tom Chen: In an inquiry, I'd walk through your specific requirements.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.200
Tom Chen: Then recommend 2 or 3 vendors worth evaluating.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.500
Tom Chen: And help you understand the trade-offs between them.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.800
David Porter: Do you have relationships with vendors that might bias your recommendations?

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.200
Jennifer Martinez: We're very transparent about this. Vendors can purchase.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.500
Jennifer Martinez: Research services from us - things like being included in our Waves.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.800
Jennifer Martinez: Or getting briefings on our research findings.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.200
Jennifer Martinez: But that doesn't influence our recommendations to buyer clients.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.500
Jennifer Martinez: We have strict ethical walls between our vendor and buyer practices.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.800
Jennifer Martinez: Tom's compensation isn't tied to vendor relationships at all.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.200
Tom Chen: My job is to give you honest, unbiased advice based on data.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.500
Tom Chen: If I recommend a vendor and it doesn't work out, I lose credibility.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.800
Tom Chen: My success is measured by your success and renewal rates.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.200
Michael Stevens: Okay, that's reassuring. What about international coverage?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.500
Michael Stevens: We have operations in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.800
Jennifer Martinez: We're a global firm with analysts in every major region.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.200
Jennifer Martinez: You'd have access to our analysts worldwide, not just North America.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.500
Jennifer Martinez: We cover regional regulatory differences, market dynamics.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.800
Jennifer Martinez: And can connect you with local experts for market-specific questions.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.200
Rachel Kim: How do you handle confidential information?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.500
Rachel Kim: Some of our technology initiatives are competitively sensitive.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.800
Tom Chen: We treat all client conversations as strictly confidential.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.200
Tom Chen: We don't share your specific strategies or plans with anyone.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.500
Tom Chen: When we publish research, we aggregate and anonymize insights.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.800
Tom Chen: You'll never see "Meridian Financial is doing X" in our reports.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.200
Tom Chen: We also sign NDAs when necessary for particularly sensitive topics.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.500
Jennifer Martinez: We take data security and confidentiality extremely seriously.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.800
Jennifer Martinez: It's foundational to our business model and reputation.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.200
Michael Stevens: This all sounds promising. What are the next steps?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.500
Jennifer Martinez: I'd like to send you a formal proposal with detailed scope and pricing.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.800
Jennifer Martinez: I can also arrange for you to speak with a current client as a reference.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.200
Jennifer Martinez: Someone from a similar financial institution who can share their experience.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.500
Jennifer Martinez: And we could schedule a follow-up call to address any additional questions.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.800
Michael Stevens: That sounds good. I'd definitely like to speak with a reference client.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.200
Michael Stevens: And I'll need to discuss this with our CFO and CEO before committing.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.500
Jennifer Martinez: Absolutely understood. Would it be helpful for me to prepare.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.800
Jennifer Martinez: Some materials you could share with them? ROI analysis, case studies?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.200
Michael Stevens: Yes, that would be helpful. Especially ROI justification.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.500
Rachel Kim: I'd also like to understand the research access in more detail.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.800
Rachel Kim: Maybe you could give us a demo of the portal?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.200
Jennifer Martinez: Perfect. I can schedule a 30-minute portal demo with you.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.500
Jennifer Martinez: You'll be able to see exactly what research is available.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.800
Jennifer Martinez: And how our search and recommendation features work.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.200
David Porter: When would we be able to start if we sign up?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.500
Jennifer Martinez: We can typically onboard new clients within one week.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.800
Jennifer Martinez: So if you sign by end of month, you could have your first inquiry.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.200
Jennifer Martinez: In early March. We'd make sure Tom is available for priority scheduling.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.500
Tom Chen: And I'd personally make sure your onboarding is smooth.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.800
Tom Chen: I'd join your kickoff call to understand your immediate priorities.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.200
Tom Chen: And recommend which other analysts you should connect with.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.500
Michael Stevens: Okay, this has been a very productive conversation.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.800
Michael Stevens: I appreciate you taking the time to understand our situation.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.200
Michael Stevens: Rather than just giving us a generic pitch.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.500
Jennifer Martinez: That's exactly our approach. We want this to be a true partnership.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.800
Jennifer Martinez: Not just a vendor relationship. Your success is our success.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.200
Tom Chen: And I'm excited about the possibility of working with you all.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.500
Tom Chen: The challenges you're facing are exactly what I love helping clients navigate.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.800
Rachel Kim: Thank you both. This was very informative.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.200
David Porter: Yes, definitely gave us a lot to think about.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.500
Jennifer Martinez: Wonderful. Let me send over those materials by tomorrow.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.800
Jennifer Martinez: And I'll coordinate the reference call and portal demo.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.200
Jennifer Martinez: Should we schedule a follow-up for next week?

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.500
Michael Stevens: Let's plan for next Friday. That gives us time to review everything.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.800
Michael Stevens: And have internal discussions.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.200
Jennifer Martinez: Perfect. I'll send a calendar invite. Thanks again everyone.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.500
Tom Chen: Looking forward to working with you. Have a great rest of your day.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.800
Michael Stevens: You too. Thanks Jennifer, thanks Tom.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.500
Rachel Kim: Bye everyone.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
David Porter: Take care.
