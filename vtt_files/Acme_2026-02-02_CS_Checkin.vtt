00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
JORDAN LEE: Good morning, Maya! Thanks for taking the time today. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this focused.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I wanted to show you how Forrester's AI Assistant can help you and your team get answers from our research much faster.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
MAYA PATEL: Morning, Jordan. Yes, I'm definitely interested. We're paying for Forrester, but honestly, my team tells me they find it hard to navigate.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They say there's great content, but finding the right report takes too long.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
JORDAN LEE: That's the most common feedback we hear, and it's exactly why we built the AI Assistant.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So instead of your team searching for documents and reading through multiple reports, they can now just ask their question directly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and get a synthesized answer with citations. Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
MAYA PATEL: Okay, I'm curious how this actually works.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
JORDAN LEE: Perfect. I'm sharing my screen now. Can you see the Forrester platform?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
MAYA PATEL: Yes, I've got it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
JORDAN LEE: Great. So this is the AI Assistant interface - see this search bar at the top?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to ask a question that's relevant to your digital strategy work.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let me type: "What are the key trends in digital customer experience for 2026?"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm hitting enter now... and you'll see it takes about five to ten seconds to analyze all the relevant research

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and generate a response. Here we go.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay, look at this response. The AI has identified four major trends:

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
AI-powered personalization at scale, conversational commerce, privacy-first experience design, and omnichannel orchestration.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But notice - it's not just listing trends. For each one, it's explaining what it means, why it matters,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and how companies are implementing it. And see these citations throughout?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Every claim links back to the specific Forrester report and even the specific section where that information comes from.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
MAYA PATEL: So it's actually reading the reports and synthesizing information across multiple sources?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
JORDAN LEE: Exactly right. This answer is pulling from six different Forrester reports - you can see them listed at the bottom.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The AI understands the content, identifies patterns across our research, and synthesizes it into a coherent answer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If I click on this citation here... see? It takes you directly to that paragraph in the original report.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're not starting at page one of a forty-page document.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
MAYA PATEL: That's really helpful. So what about follow-up questions? Like, what if I want to dig deeper on one of these trends?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
JORDAN LEE: Great question. The AI is conversational, so you can ask follow-ups and it maintains context.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Watch this - I'm going to ask: "Tell me more about AI-powered personalization. What are the specific use cases?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
See how it understood that I'm asking about the first trend from the previous answer?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's now giving me specific use cases: predictive product recommendations, dynamic content adaptation,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
behavioral trigger automation, and personalized pricing strategies. Each with examples and citations.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This is the power of conversational research - you can drill down naturally without starting over each time.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
MAYA PATEL: Okay, this is actually impressive. But I need to ask about accuracy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
How do I know the AI isn't making things up or misinterpreting the research?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
JORDAN LEE: Critical question, and we've been obsessive about this. First, the AI only uses actual Forrester research -

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
it's not trained on the general internet. It can only answer based on content we've published.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Second, every substantive claim has a citation that you can verify immediately.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Third, if you ask something outside Forrester's coverage area, the AI explicitly tells you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
"We don't have research on this topic" rather than trying to fake an answer.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
MAYA PATEL: What happens if there's conflicting information in different reports?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
JORDAN LEE: Another great question. The AI is trained to recognize disagreement or different perspectives.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Let me show you. I'll ask: "What's the best pricing model for SaaS products?"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Look at how it handles this. It says "Forrester research identifies multiple pricing approaches, each suited to different contexts."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Then it lays out usage-based pricing, tiered subscription, value-based pricing, and freemium models -

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
explaining the advantages and tradeoffs of each with citations. It's not giving you a false sense of certainty

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
when there isn't one clear answer. Instead, it's helping you understand the decision landscape.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
MAYA PATEL: I appreciate that nuance. That actually makes me trust it more.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
JORDAN LEE: That's exactly the reaction we want. The AI is designed to make you more informed, not to make decisions for you.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, let me show you one more thing that your team will love - comparative analysis.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'll ask: "Compare the leading marketing automation platforms for mid-market B2B companies."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The AI automatically formats this as a comparison table because it understood the question type.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You're seeing the major players, their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal customer profiles -

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
all linked to our Wave evaluations and vendor assessments. This kind of analysis would normally take someone

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
hours to compile manually, and now it's done in seconds.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
MAYA PATEL: This would save my team so much time. How do we actually get access to this?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
JORDAN LEE: It's an add-on to your existing Forrester subscription. For your organization size,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we're looking at about forty-five thousand annually, which gives all your users unlimited access.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
When you break down the ROI - if each person saves even just three hours a month,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
you're looking at a ten-to-one return on that investment.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
MAYA PATEL: That math makes sense. What's the implementation process like?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
JORDAN LEE: Super straightforward. Once you sign the agreement, we activate it within three to five business days.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
All your existing users will see the AI Assistant the next time they log in - no separate login, no new system to learn.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We provide training resources and I'd schedule a live session with your team to show them best practices.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You could have everyone up and running within two weeks.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
MAYA PATEL: And there's support if we have questions or issues?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
JORDAN LEE: Absolutely. You'll still have me as your customer success manager, plus our support team is available via email and chat.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Average response time is under two hours for any issues. We also have an AI Assistant user community

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where people share tips and use cases.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
MAYA PATEL: Okay, I'm definitely interested. What are the next steps?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
JORDAN LEE: I'll send you a detailed proposal today with pricing, implementation timeline, and some case studies

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
from similar companies. I can also set up a demo for your broader team if you want others to see this in action

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
before making the decision. Does that work?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
MAYA PATEL: Yes, that sounds perfect. Let me review the proposal, and I'll probably want to show this to my VP

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and a few of my team leads. Can we schedule that broader demo for next week?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
JORDAN LEE: Absolutely. I'll send some time options in my follow-up email. And Maya, if any questions come up

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
as you're reviewing, just reach out directly. I'm here to help.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
MAYA PATEL: Great, thanks Jordan. This was really helpful.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
JORDAN LEE: My pleasure. Talk soon!
